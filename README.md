# Neural-Nets-using-Tensorflow-Keras

Use Tensorflow to detect fraud bank notes using the UCI datasets.

POC details:
We use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository. Deep Learning by taking a a quick look at the effectiveness of Neural Nets. We also present a comparison of deep neural nets with RandomForest classifier to see which is a better approach for our domain problem and this specific dataset.

Data:
Our data consists of 5 columns: variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous), entropy of image (continuous), class (integer)

Goal:
Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic. Our goal is to be able to build a robust classifer to identify the authentic fiat vis-a-vis the fraud notes.
